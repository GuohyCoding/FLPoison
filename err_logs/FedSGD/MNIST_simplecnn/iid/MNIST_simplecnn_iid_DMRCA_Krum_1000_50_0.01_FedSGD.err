torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 2.00 MiB. GPU 1 has a total capacity of 15.72 GiB of which 2.44 MiB is free. Process 1108666 has 14.74 GiB memory in use. Process 1150967 has 276.00 MiB memory in use. Process 1150965 has 310.00 MiB memory in use. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 266.00 MiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 59.79 MiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 18.21 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
